To produce the figures run the script labelled Run_Me.py with All_Fun in the same directory.

The Task1 figure from the fits theoretical sinc function well. There is a small
deviation from the expected height. Perhaps this is an inevitable artefact of
removing higher spatial frequencies.

As the second aperture is the product of a sine wave and a top hat
and a sine function, we expect the image to be a convolution of a
delta function pair and a sinc function.
The task2 figure meets this expectation, although the
theoretical relation has not been derived.

For the supplementary task (task 3) the aperture phase is corrected,
As expected this produces plots which show more Fresnel diffraction type features.

Script 1_CT1_S1_Sine_Integrator.py fulfills Core Task 1 and Supplementary Task 1.
It produces figures A, B and B2, which show that the multiple integration Function
does converge on the correct value, and that the errors reduce in the manner
expected.

Script 2_CT2_Cornu_Integrator.py produces figure C, showing a cornu Spiral.

Scipt 3_S2_Slit.py produces some Fresnel diffraction patterns for slits
(Figures D and E), for different distances from the slit (D). These fit my
expectation.a
